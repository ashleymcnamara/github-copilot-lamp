# Guide: Build Your Own 
The copilot lamp is fairly easy to assemble with a bit of soldering. The hardest part is patiently waiting for all the parts to print! ðŸ˜‰

In short, it is a few 3D printed parts, a microcontroller, some LEDs and a few wires to connect it all together.

- 3/8" Shrink Tubing [[US]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FK17W6B)

### Tools
- Soldering Iron
- 3D Printer

> [!NOTE]
> **Tip:** Don't have a 3D printer? Check if your local library has a makerspace. They might be able to print the parts for you! ðŸ¤©


# Instructions
The lamp is designed to be assembled by hand, minus the small amount of soldering. It's printed with regular PLA filament on a printer with at least 200x200mm print area.

## 1. Print the parts
The .STL files for all of the printable parts are in the `/models` folder.

- No supports are required.
- For a textured look, consider a textured plate. [[US]](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-dual-sided-textured-pei-plate)

> [!NOTE]  
> The backplate, faceplate, and eyes don't have to be black.
> Try printing them in another color or with fun multicolor or shiny filament! ðŸ¦„ ðŸ¤©
