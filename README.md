# GitHub Copilot Lamp
A fun and playful lamp to match the energy of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). It's 3d printable, fairly easy to assemble, WiFi connected and powered by [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) and touch!

> This project was inspired by the original [Octolamp](https://github.com/martinwoodward/octolamp). Go check it out!
